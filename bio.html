		<h1>Faith Abiria Ocitti</h1>
		<p>Hello!</p>
		<p>My name is Faith A Ocitti and I am a rising junior at Tufts
		University, a connoisseur of breakfast foods, a lover of long 
		chats, and a frequent user of the interweb.</p>
		<p>As a proud citizen of Botswana, I use <i>s</i>'s insted of
		<i>z</i>'s (i.e. organisation) and I never forget the 
		<i>u</i>'s (it's "colour", not 'color"). I have an ever-
		expanding vocabulary of non-words and I am a fierce believer
		in the Oxford comma.</p>
		<p>Currently, I study Biomedical Engineering and 
		Computer Science.  We are complex beings with a lot of little
		bits and bobs that we don't quite understand. And I am 
		interested in further exploring the use of technology to 
		analyse and understand the hoards of biological data we have
		amassed.</p>
