		<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The following is a security analysis of the website <a href="https://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com">
			https://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com</a>. The website logs the check-in information of site vistors and 
			the resultant logs are stored in a Mongo data base. However, with the increasing prevelance of noSQL 
			databases which provide highly flexible data management, there should similarly be an increasing emphasis 
			on securing said databases. Websites that are not properly sanitised prove to be a breeding ground for 
			hacking and general tomfoolery. The following assessment of the website includes vulneranilities 
			as well as possible remedies.</p>
		<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<p>The security of this website was evaluated in two steps:</p>
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>"Grey-box" analysis was performed where the code was not reviewed. However, there were certain
					pieces of information that were acquired from observing how the website was used and breached. This
					information that was distributed over an <a href="https://piazza.com">online forum</a>
					assessing how best to breach the website.</li>
					<li>After the initial analysis, the code was analysed for glaring security risks. Additionally, in
					this phase, remedies to the the problems identified from the grey-box analysis were retrieved.</li>
				</ul>
		<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
			<p>The assessment of the website found several potential security breaches. These were mainly a result of the lack of data verification where the
			client was given free reign to manipulate aspects of the website which in turn would affect the website in its entirity. Additionally, a lot of the
			data was exposed in the writing of the code so that some information was more accessible to the user than it should have been.</p>
		<h1>Issues Found</h1>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
					<p>Perhaps the most glaring vulneranility is that of cross-site scripting of HTML and JavaScript
					into the clientside interface. This usability enables the potentail hacker to manipulate the script such 
					that malicious content can be sent back from the server wreaking havoc on the poor user.</p>
					<p>The following line of code was implemented to successfully check in to the website without any permissions:</p>
					<p><span class="code">curl --data "login=mchow&lat=0&lng=0" https://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/sendLocation</span></p>
					<p>This vulneranility is particularly severe because the potentail hacker could use the <span class="other_code">login</span>
					field to implement JavaScript such as:
						<ul>
							<li><span class="code">alert('Malware was detected on your device. To secure your machine[...]')</span><br/><br/>
							The code above, while immediately malignant, may lead to susceptible
							users following the instructions on the page and venturing into untrusted territory. Additionally, once
							a hack is made it is possible for other curious hackers to follow with increasingly aggressive material
							as experienced on the website between 03/07/2017 and 05/07/2017.</li><br/>
							<li><span class="code">window.location='https:www.google.com/search?q=what+is+xss'</span><br/><br/>
							This script could be particularly malicious if the user was redirected to a website capable of targetting user
							information and perhaps infecting the user machine with malware.</li>

						</ul>
				<h4>Potential Remedy</h4>
					<p>All user input must be validated. The html code only ensures that the login is not undefined. This is not sufficient in a
					scenario where the website is exposed to the public. It is therfore essential to escape all user inputted data before it is 
					transmitted to the database. This can be done by replacing all html special characters with the equivalent non-special text string. 
					There are many software packages that perform the role of sanitisation. Through npm there are modules
					such as <span class="code">Helmet</span> and <span class="code">sanitize-html</span> that perform the job sufficiently enabling moderate
					security.</p></li>
				<li><h3>Data Overflow</h3>
					<p>There were two types of data overflows (or perhaps datum overflows?) identified:
					<p><b>Input Overflow:</b> There is no cap as to how many characters can be inputted in the login field. This is a minor security
					risk although long unmonitored entry could make cross-site scripting easier to execute.</p>
					<p><b>Server Overflow:</b> Another security risk identified was the lack of regulation of how many times a user can access a website. This initially benign
					oversight could be manipulated by a potential hacker to bring down a website by swarming the database with unnecessaey information
					making it near impossible for other users to access. This overloading of the system can not only inhibit other users from using 
					the website, but also completely crash the server. Mongo data bases provide a finite amount of space, and 
					<a href="https://github.com/tuftsdev/comp20-focitti/blob/master/security/loop.bash">a simple shell script</a>
					coding for an infinite loop could be responsible for bringing down a website.</p>
				<h4>Potential Remedy</h4>
					<p><b>Input Overflow:</b> This can be easily regulated by ensuring that the number of characters are less than a reasonable amount. The
					creator of the website is able to anticipate how the website can be used and thereby anticipate usage parameters.</p>
					<p><b>Server Overflow:</b> The server overflow on the other hand is a little more complicated. The web developper may chose to implement
					code that ensures that a particular authorisation code, IP address or login can only be used a certain number of times within a specified period 
					of time.</p></li>
				<li><h3>NoSQL Injections</h3>
					<p>NoSQL injections are a rampant form of attacking a website as it is possible to retrieve susceptible user information. A striking example of
					such an attack uses the operator <span class="code">[$ne]</span> to display all the documentation of the site where the user is not 'mchow':
					<p><span class="code">http://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/checkins.json?login[$ne]=mchow</span></p>
					<p>This makes the user vuleranable to having their data acquired and distrivuted.</p>
				<h4>Potential Remedy</h4>
					<p>The easiest way to prevent such attacks is validation of all data provided in the URL. This may include verifying that the data is in fact
					a string so that strings of characters are not translated into operators or other forms of text that could potentially expose user data beyond
					specification.</p></li>
				<li><h3>Other Security Concerns</h3>
					<p>There are a few minor concerns that might ultimately lead to major problems in the website:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><span class="code">response.set('Content-Type','text/html');</span><br/><br/>
							It is never a good idea to set parameters in functions where retrieving said parameters is readily available. This can be manipulated
							so as to change th econtent and use the website in a way the web developper did not intend. Data abstraction is key. The user must 
							never be exposed to parameters the developper is setting. Moving code outside of the get function may help alleviate some
							of these concerns.</li><br/>
							<li><span class="code">response.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");</span><br/><br/>
							Although this line of code is easy to implement and is used to circumvent tedious tasks that come with regulation, it is 
							basically welcoming requests to unintended target origins. It is best in this case to specify the target origin in order
							to ensure that the website is used as it was created to be used.</li>

						</ul></li>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In summation, it is important to secure any and all data possible. It is infintely more cost effeciant to spend resources
			developing a website that will be relatively secure as opposed to spending resources trying to patch up security concerns. The internet is not 
			secure and a noSQL database such as MongoDB is especially insecure. Many technologies, such as
			NoSQLMap, exist for this purpose: to exploit vulneranilities. Therefore it is in the web programmer's best interest to put up
			every defense mechanism they can from encapsulating data better to escaping ALWAYS, and sanitising code to changing default settings.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, the damage to this website will cost more time to fix now, than it would have costed to create at full capacity. Assuming the web
			programmer eats two meals a day with snacks, averaging about $15; their typing speed is about 40 words per minute; and they take a 10 minute break
			every half hour as well as a half hour break every 3 hours - it would cost at least $60 to repair this website accounting for a daily 10 hour nap 
			period.</p>
